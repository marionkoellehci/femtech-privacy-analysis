The connection between the sensor and the app is protected by the Bluetooth LE protocol. The HTTP connection between the app and the backend is encrypted using the TLS method (TLS 1.2). In addition, the integrity of the transmitted data is protected by an asymmetric encryption procedure (public-private key procedure: ECC). Digital signatures prevent the data you transmit from being changed unnoticed (content, sequence, completeness).",
